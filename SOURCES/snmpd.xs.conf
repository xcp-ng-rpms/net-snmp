# As shipped, the snmpd demon will only respond to queries on the
# system mib group until this file is replaced or modified for
# security purposes.

####
# First, map the community name "public" into a "security name"

#       sec.name       source        community
com2sec notConfigUser  default       public

####
# Second, map the security name into a group name:

#       groupName      securityModel securityName
group   notConfigGroup v2c           notConfigUser

####
# Third, create a view for us to let the group have rights to:

#	name          incl/excl  subtree         mask(optional)
view	systemview    included   .1
view	systemview    included   system
view	systemview    included   interfaces
view	systemview    included   at
view	systemview    included   ip
view	systemview    included   icmp
view	systemview    included   tcp
view	systemview    included   udp
view    systemview    included   snmp

####
# XenServer control domain does not support IPv6.
#
view	systemview    excluded   ipv6InterfaceTableLastChange
view	systemview    excluded   icmpStatsInErrors.ipv6
view	systemview    excluded   icmpStatsInMsgs.ipv6
view	systemview    excluded   icmpStatsOutErrors.ipv6
view	systemview    excluded   icmpStatsOutMsgs.ipv6
view	systemview    excluded   icmpMsgStatsInPkts.ipv6
view	systemview    excluded   icmpMsgStatsOutPkts.ipv6

####
# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.

#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read       write  notif
access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  systemview none   none
